# humanity-core
I think we can all agree -- it is time for a change.

No society has perfected how humans should govern themselves. Some may seem a little better than others. But even the most well-meaning idealogy can be corrupted if the people "in charge" decide to abuse their power. The corruption of power is a fundamental human flaw. There may be a few people in every generation capable of wanting the best for their people. But those people are rarely equipped with the other resources to take a position of power. Those who seek power rarely deserve it, and those who would use it for good can rarely attain it.

In societies that manage to mitigate some of that power, there is an incredible amount of bureaucracy. The time it takes to make meaningful changes is painfully slow.

The current global pandemic is a tragedy. But let us find a silver lining. Let us embrace our shared suffering as well as our unprecedented level of connectivity through technology. We no longer have to allow a chosen elite or elected official to tell us what to do. We can decide for ourselves, as a true democracy, enabled by technology.

There is a lot to consider to be able to pull off something of this scale. But if this is indeed a worthy idea, it will go viral on its own, and everyone will pitch in to make it a reality.

## Core Philosophies

We value human life above all else.

We are greater than the sum of our parts.

We will trust in humanity, but also protect ourselves from it.

We will never be perfect, but we must always be able to adapt and iterate quickly.

Everything needs to be open, decentralized, and accessible to all.


## Ideas
These require further refinement and organization. This repository should eventually turn into a landing page with links to many other repositories.

### Technology
Technology has evolved such that internet access should be considered a fundamental human right. It is now possible for any human anywhere on earth to connect with any other human anywhere on earth. We can collaborate on human problems like never before.

With a device in the hands of every capable adult on the planet, we can enable a true democracy.

#### Architecture
In line with the core philosophies, the technological infrastructure behind this movement must be based on open source technologies and distributed across the globe.

The "backend" must be cloud-agnostic, but capable of being deployed on all of the major cloud providers. OpenStack? Docker?

The primary interface point to the backend will be a GraphQL API. The services behind the API can be written in whatever language you want, so long as they expose a JSON-RPC API.

Any time a piece of the puzzle sounds like something else that already exists, try to reuse that piece. For example: In the following section about enacting change, I mention social media, code-review, and crowdsourcing. If at all possible, just literally hook into existing social media platforms, code management software, and crowdsourcing platforms. Don't re-invent anything. We're all in this together.

The initial primary frontend will be a responsive web UI. That should cover the vast majority of devices, and then we can address any gaps.

### Enacting Change
Every adult human across the globe has to have a voice.

Once a week, everyone submits their top priority "issue" on four levels.

1. Global
2. National
3. Provincial
4. Local

These issues are automatically grouped and sorted, with the top priorities bubbling to the top. The top issue at each level is then open for proposals. We connect the entire world to crowdsource solutions to our most pressing problems.

Here is one possible example:

*Global*: Access to clean water
*National*: (United States) Healthcare
*Provincial*: (Washington State) Clean Energy
*Local*: (Olympia, WA) Homeless Population

This example is biased towards the problems *I* would like to see addressed on those levels. In reality, we would solve the problems that the majority of people decide are important.

Once the issues are made clear, the floor is open for proposals. The proposal evolution process would be a blend of viral social media and how we manage open-source code. You share your plan with people; they "like" it and share it with more people. People who like it but see ways to improve it can provide suggestions, much like code reviews. Once a proposal reaches a certain threshold of "likes" above the contending proposals, we hold a final vote to approve the plan.

Not only is a plan gated by requiring a majority vote -- it must reach a fully funded state. We do away with traditional taxes. Everyone gets to put their money towards the projects that they want to see executed. In a way, this is like Kickstarter or GoFundMe.

Once a plan is approved and funded, we move to the execution phase. This phase will vary widely, depending on the problem. It could take weeks. It could take years. No matter the timeline, regular and transparent status updates are required. The people must re-evaluate any project at risk of failing. Amendments to the plan, increases in funding, or dissolving of the project are all viable options to address failure.
